# DualSteganography
Mostly the work was split between the function work (.cpp .h) and the main + testing
Tucker understood the bit work better than me so he handled that while I (Braden) coded the main and tested the code

Operation is fairly simple
Input which operation you wish to do then input the ppm file you wish to operate on
After which, depending on operation, input the required text files and designate new files as needed
